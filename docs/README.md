# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation hub! This collection of guides provides a comprehensive framework for delivering successful projects through clear processes, effective collaboration, and continuous improvement.

## Our Approach

OctoAcme's project management methodology emphasizes **practical, lightweight processes** that enable teams to deliver value quickly while maintaining high quality and transparency. We believe in empowering teams with clear guidance while avoiding excessive overhead.

Whether you're a new team member getting oriented, a project manager planning your first project, or a stakeholder seeking to understand our delivery approach, these docs will help you navigate OctoAcme's project lifecycle.

## Core Principles

Our project management practices are built on five foundational principles:

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments rather than big-bang releases
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has named owners with defined responsibilities
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence, not assumptions
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and blameless retrospectives

## Project Lifecycle

OctoAcme projects follow a five-phase lifecycle designed to move from idea to impact efficiently:

```
Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective
```

### 1. **Initiation**
Validate the business need, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight project charter. This phase answers "Should we do this?" and establishes clear success criteria.

### 2. **Planning**
Transform the approved initiative into an actionable plan with prioritized backlog, resource allocation, and risk identification. This phase sets the team up for efficient execution.

### 3. **Execution**
Manage day-to-day delivery through iterative development, regular standups, and continuous tracking. Teams build, test, review, and adapt based on progress and feedback.

### 4. **Release**
Deploy features to production safely with proper verification, rollback plans, and stakeholder communication. Quality gates ensure production readiness.

### 5. **Retrospective**
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements. This phase closes the project while setting the stage for future success.

## Key Roles

OctoAcme projects rely on clear role definitions and collaborative teamwork:

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, manages schedules, risks, and stakeholder communication
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure code quality
- **QA/Testing**: Validate acceptance criteria and quality standards
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, approvals, and strategic guidance

## How to Use These Docs

- **Keep them current**: Update process docs when we learn better approaches
- **Make them accessible**: Add relevant docs to `.copilot/` directories so GitHub Copilot Spaces can use them as context
- **Adapt as needed**: These are guidelines, not rigid rules. Tailor them to your project's specific needs
- **Share feedback**: Contribute improvements through pull requests or retrospective action items

## Questions or Feedback?

These docs are living artifacts that improve through team feedback. If you have questions, suggestions, or spot opportunities for improvement, please:

- Open an issue in the project repository
- Bring it up in your retrospective
- Reach out to your Project Manager or Product Lead

Let's build great things together! 🚀
